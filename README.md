## Getting Started
In order to get started, make sure you are meeting all requirements listed above.
Then, just go ahead and download the gulp-starter-kit. For this, you can choose between the following options:

### Git clone
One way of downloading the gulp-starter-kit is by cloning this Git repository. Before executing any commands, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.

Then, follow these instructions:

1. Execute `git clone https://github.com/jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit.git your-project-name`. This creates a folder called `your-project-name` (change that to your project name) at the current location where your terminal / command prompt is pointing to.
2. Change your working directory to your project folder by executing `cd your-project-name`.
3. Install all dependencies by executing `npm install`.
4. Spin up your web development environment with the command `npm start`.
5. Start coding!

If you are lazy, just do everything at once:

```
git clone https://github.com/jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit.git your-project-name && cd your-project-name && npm install && npm start
```

### npm init
The other, recommended way of downloading the gulp-starter-kit uses the command `npm init` and the [gulp-starter-kit npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jr-cologne/create-gulp-starter-kit) as the initializer.

For this, just follow these steps:

1. Execute `npm init @jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit your-project-name`. This creates a folder called `your-project-name` (change that to your project name) at the current location where your terminal / command prompt is pointing to. Moreover, this initializes your project and installs all dependencies.
2. Change your working directory to your project folder by executing `cd your-project-name`.
3. Spin up your web development environment with the command `npm start`.
4. Start coding!

In case you are lazy, just use this command:

```
npm init @jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit your-project-name && cd your-project-name && npm start
```

## Usage / FAQ
### What types of images are supported?
The following types of images are currently supported:

- PNG
- JPG / JPEG
- GIF
- SVG
- ICO (not compressed)

### How can I specify dependencies which are then copied to the `dist` folder?
You don't need to specify your dependencies anywhere else than in your `package.json` file.
Just install your dependencies via npm and all your dependencies get automatically loaded and copied into the `dist` folder.

### How can I load dependencies inside my application?
ES6 modules are supported by the `gulp-starter-kit`.
Just install your dependencies and import them like so:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
```
